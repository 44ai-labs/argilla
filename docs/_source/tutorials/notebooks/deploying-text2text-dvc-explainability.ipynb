Alternatively, you can take a look at our [Elasticsearch docs](../../getting_started/installation/elasticsearch.md) about creating retention snapshots directly from your Elasticsearch cluster.

    "It is important to be able to keep track and store data to version data used in training cycles and to avoid losing data alltogether. DVC creates a reference to your data and stores it within an external storage repo. Pushing this reference to get allows us to reproduce certain stages of your repository, while also having a copy of the exact data that was in the repo during that exact time. Think \"git for data\".\n",
